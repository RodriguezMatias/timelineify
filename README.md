### What?
Create a playlist containing a Spotify artist's discography in chronological order.

### Why?
Spotify messes with the order of albums & singles, making it difficult to hear an artist's works in the order they were released. Timelineify generates a chronological playlist of an artist's entire discography with a few clicks!

#### But really, why?

### How? 
Uses the Spotify API to query artists and create sorted playlists. Uses React, Chakra UI, and Netlify for a serverless frontend.
